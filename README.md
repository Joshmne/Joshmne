Hi, I’m Joshua 👋

I’m a Product Manager who likes working where complex systems meet real users. I’ve shipped products across Web3/DeFi, AR/VR collaboration, and public‑sector digital tools.

What I’m focused on now
- Product roles in DeFi, impact/GovTech, and data‑driven products
- Turning technical constraints into clear, simple user journeys
- Using data, UX, and user research to make product decisions

What you’ll find here
- Product case studies (problem → research → PRD → design → learnings)
- Small data/analytics projects
- Simple prototypes and experiments

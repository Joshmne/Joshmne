- Project Navigator – From Idea to Shipped Product

Overview
Project Navigator is a small product case study that shows how I work as a Product Manager from problem discovery to a shipped solution. This repository includes the problem definition, research notes, PRD, simple wireframes, and a basic prototype to demonstrate how I turn a vague problem into a clear, testable product.

Why I built this
As a Product Manager, I don’t just write documents – I’m responsible for turning messy problems into products that real people can use. I created this project to:
- Show how I structure a product from zero to one
- Document my thinking at each stage (problem, research, scope, design, delivery)
- Give hiring managers and collaborators a concrete example of how I work

What’s in this repo
- `01_problem-definition/` – Problem statement, target users, constraints, and success metrics
- `02_research/` – User interviews, survey results, or secondary research notes
- `03_prd/` – Product Requirements Document with:
- goals, scope, user stories, edge cases, and non-functional requirements
- `04_design/` – Low-fidelity wireframes, user flows, or screenshots (Figma links or exports)
- `05_implementation/` – Basic prototype or mock UI (this can be a simple web app, clickable prototype, or notebook)
- `06_learnings/` – What worked, what didn’t, and what I would do next

How to use this repo
If you’re reviewing my work as a Product Manager, I recommend this order:
1. Start with `01_problem-definition/` to understand the problem and context
2. Skim `02_research/` to see how I validated the problem and gathered insight
3. Read `03_prd/` to see how I translate insight into scope and requirements
4. Look at `04_design/` and `05_implementation/` to see how it came to life
5. Finish with `06_learnings/` for my reflection and next steps

Tools used
- Documentation: Google Docs / Notion (exported as PDF/Markdown here)
- Design: Figma (screenshots or exports in `04_design/`)
- Prototype: Basic web app / notebook / mock UI, as appropriate for the project

What this project shows about me as a PM
- I start with a clear problem and success criteria before talking about features
- I connect research to concrete product decisions
- I communicate in a way that designers, engineers, and stakeholders can all understand
- I document decisions and learnings so the team can move faster over time

This repository is not meant to be a perfect product, but a transparent view of how I think and work as a Product Manager.
